awesome when someone starts to use it.

## Installing / Getting started

To get started with our Django-based "Hello World" project, users will need to have Python and Django installed on their system. After installation, the following steps should be followed:

### Install Python and Django
Ensure Python is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the official Python website. After installing Python, install Django using pip with the following command:

```bash
pip install django
```

### Configure the Database
Modify the Django project's settings to configure the database according to your requirements. Typically, this involves adjusting the database engine, name, user, password, and host in the `settings.py` file.

Apply Migrations: Run the following command to apply the database migrations and create the necessary database schema:

``` bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Start the Development Server
Launch the Django development server using the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```    

This will start the server, and your "Hello World" Django application will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ or http://localhost:8000/ in your web browser.


## Features

### Main Functionality

The primary function of this website is to facilitate event management for users. Users can create accounts, allowing them to create new events, cancel existing ones, and access detailed event information. The platform streamlines the process of organizing events, providing users with a centralized hub for their scheduling needs.

### Additional Functionality

In addition to event creation and cancellation, users have the option to enhance their account security. The website allows users to change their passwords, adding an extra layer of protection to their accounts. While basic in nature, this feature empowers users to maintain the confidentiality of their accounts, ensuring secure access to their event-related information.

### Note
While the functionality is limited to event management and password change, the website's simplicity ensures a user-friendly experience. Users can focus on the essential task of organizing and managing their events without the complexity of additional features, making it an efficient and straightforward solution for event coordination.
